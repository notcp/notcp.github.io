        <h2>yet another hipster technology manifesto</h2>

<p>Oh yes indeed. Just as <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/package-summary.html#multiplex">NIO</a> proved to the world that bare-metal performance is always worth the consequent unreadable code, just as the <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">flood</a> <a href="http://redis.io/">of</a> <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">bespoke</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL databases</a> taught us to value purpose-built solutions over general ones, and just as the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Manifesto</a> reminded us that new branding can give a youthful glow to decades-old ideas, we follow in their Chukka-booted footsteps by challenging the comforts of the ubiquitous <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">Transmission Control Protocol</a> and recognizing the well-deserved renaissance of artisanal protocols built on <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768">UDP</a>. We didn’t start this fire, we’re just calling it what it is: <em>the NoTCP movement</em>.</p>

<h2>reliability numbs the senses</h2>

<p>The thing TCP aims to provide over raw IP or UDP is <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#page-4">reliability</a>. Packets are error checked, explicitly acknowledged or retransmitted as needed, and reassembled in order; the user is notified if reads or writes may have failed. This can be a handy correctness property for certain applications to build on, but we argue that branding this property “reliability” is awfully misleading. The Oxford English Dictionary defines <em>reliable</em>, as an adjective, to mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Of a person, information, etc.: <em>able to be trusted; in which reliance or confidence may be placed; trustworthy, safe, sure.</em></li>
  <li>Of a product, service, etc.: <em>consistently good in quality or performance; dependable.</em></li>
  <li>Of a method or technique of measurement: <em>yields consistent results when repeated under identical conditions.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This gives us warm, fuzzy feelings toward TCP that it doesn’t properly deserve. That is, it might inappropriately suggest “TCP never fails” rather than “TCP never <em>silently</em> fails.” Furthermore, failure is defined to some extent by the user: all of TCP’s sequencing and retransmission of lost packets takes time — occasionally a <em>really long</em> time — and we simply can’t wait forever. We typically have some (perhaps limited) control over <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#page-41">retransmission timeouts</a>, and our socket APIs should always provide control over <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#page-46">user timeouts</a> (for example, POSIX’s <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/setsockopt.html">setsockopt</a>). Still, we rely on implementation-defined default timeouts and neglect to handle failures, complacent in our ignorance, because “TCP is reliable.”</p>

<h2>if at first you don’t succeed</h2>

<p>TCP is a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#page-23">connection-oriented</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#page-5">multiplexing</a> protocol over IP, where a connection is identified by the IP address and port for the local and remote hosts. So suppose we’re conscientiously setting artisanal timeouts for all our TCP messages. If an individual packet is lost, as determined by the retransmit timeout, it’s sent again over the same connection; if a user timeout is reached, the connection is closed.</p>

<p>This might not be the behavior we want. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the application can tolerate some degree of packet loss, then we may want finer-grained control over retransmission. We might even prefer no retransmission at all, for real-time applications.</li>
  <li>If a client can load balance over a pool of servers, then it might make more sense to retransmit to a different server after the loss of a packet, than to retransmit to the same server. Again, this depends on the application.</li>
  <li>Mobile devices may change their IP addresses frequently as they move between wireless networks. TCP regards this as a new connection, so we either have to restart the interrupted stream from scratch, or the application layer needs to have its own notion of stream state, separate from TCP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The unifying theme here is that <em>the application knows its specific needs</em>, with respect to failure modes and recovery, better than TCP could ever anticipate. When we try to handle network failures in an application built on TCP, we invariably end up poorly reimplementing portions of TCP’s own failure handling logic, missing significant optimization opportunities in the process. Layering on TCP in many cases does us <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3439#page-7">more harm than good</a>; this is a variation of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf">end-to-end argument</a>.</p>

<h2>throwing good money after bad</h2>

<p>TCP establishes a connection with a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#page-28">three way handshake</a>, which is relatively expensive in terms of latency. Adding to the problem is <a href="http://ee.lbl.gov/papers/congavoid.pdf">slow-start</a>, which limits the throughput of a new connection for the sake of network congestion avoidance. If we want to establish multiple connections, even between the same two IPs, we need to pay these costs <em>for each connection</em>. This is common for HTTP/1.1 traffic, for example, where a client will fetch multiple resources from the same server in parallel.</p>

<p>We naturally want to avoid these per-connection costs, but here’s where things get weird: exhibiting a behavior not entirely dissimilar to Stockholm syndrome, we implement protocols that multiplex over TCP — such as <a href="http://http2.github.io/http2-spec/">HTTP/2</a> — rather than dropping down a layer. We take multiple, logical streams of data and interleave them in nondeterministic order over a single TCP connection.</p>

<p>The problem now is that TCP gives us an ordering guarantee that’s <em>much stronger</em> than we need: <em>all</em> packets are reassembled in order as they’re received, but we know that the order in which we interleaved them never mattered to begin with. One delayed packet can artificially delay the availability of the data for <em>all</em> streams multiplexed over that connection; this is one form of <em>head-of-line blocking</em>. As before, the application knows its specific needs better than TCP; in this case we’ve traded startup latency for <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.87.892">significant steady-state latency</a>, when neither is necessary.</p>

<h2>are you serious?</h2>

<p>Oh, absolutely. There are plenty of successful, purpose-built protocols that used UDP before it was cool: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#page-32">DNS</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905#page-18">NTP</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550#page-4">RTP</a>, to name a few. A more recent success is BitTorrent’s <a href="http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html">uTP</a>. But we think the poster-child for this movement might be Google’s experimental <a href="https://www.chromium.org/quic">QUIC</a> protocol. You probably haven’t heard of it, but it’s a “reliable,” connection-oriented protocol — in the same sense as TCP — that supports multiplexing without head-of-line blocking, and doesn’t arbitrarily tie a connection to an IP/port 4-tuple. It is encrypted, which provides an interesting, perhaps subtle guarantee: middle boxes can’t snoop the flow and congestion control information (such as ACKs and NACKs). This gives us some freedom to choose <a href="http://web.mit.edu/remy/">different congestion control algorithms</a> best suited to our needs.</p>

<p>Perhaps even QUIC is too fast-food for your refined, tastes, though. Maybe you think its implementation of forward error-correction is just an <a href="http://www.ecip.org/">ECIP</a> rip-off. You might view the layered <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/activities/Communications/TG11/s020269e.pdf">OSI model</a> as a <a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~yzchen/bib/layering_harmful_wakeman_network1992.pdf">fundamental</a> <a href="http://www.ieee-icnp.org/1993/papers/1993-10.pdf">mistake</a>, and look for other ways to <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/Publications/PubPDFs/Architectural%20Considerations%20for%20a%20New%20Generation%20of%20Protocols.pdf">horizontally</a> <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.39.7381&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">compose</a> new, locally-sourced protocols from modular building-blocks. Or maybe you have <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2071893">some</a> <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2076798">clue</a> about how <a href="http://bramcohen.com/2012/05/07/tcp-sucks">the internet</a> actually <a href="http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201205">works</a>, and you don’t need a manifesto to tell you what you already know.</p>
